               <h1>Privacy Policy for "Saints" App</h1>

<p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 17/8/2023</p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome to the privacy policy for the "Saints" app. We deeply respect your privacy and are committed to protecting any information you might provide or we might obtain. This privacy policy informs you about our stance on data protection when you use our app.</p>

<h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>
<p>We pride ourselves on maintaining a minimalist approach to data collection. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
    <li>We do not collect, store, or share any personal information from our users.</li>
    <li>The only piece of information we might use is the email associated with your Playstore or Appstore account. This is exclusively for the purpose of validating in-app purchases and to allow users to download resources again if the app is deleted and reinstalled.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>Our app is family-friendly and accessible by children under the age of 13. However, we emphasize that we do not knowingly collect or solicit data from children under 13 years of age.</p>

<h2>4. In-App Purchases</h2>
<p>Our app contains options for online in-app purchases. Transactions are facilitated through third-party platforms, namely, Apple App Store and Google Play Store. While we use email addresses from these platforms to validate and support the purchase processes, we do not directly handle or store payment details.</p>

<h2>5. Content Integrity</h2>
<p>"Saints" adheres to high moral and ethical standards. The app is devoid of gore, violence, drugs, or any content that might be deemed inappropriate. It's fashioned to be suitable for all age demographics.</p>

<h2>6. Your Rights and Control</h2>
<p>Given that we don't store personal data, users don't have to request its modification or deletion. Still, if there are concerns about our policy or potential data footprints, please do get in touch.</p>

<h2>7. Updates to this Policy</h2>
<p>We may refine this privacy policy periodically. Updates, when made, will be readily available on this page.</p>

<h2>8. Get in Touch</h2>
